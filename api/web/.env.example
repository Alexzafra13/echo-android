# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# API Base URL (optional - defaults to /api for same-origin requests)
# In production, the frontend is served by the backend, so no URL needed
# In development with Vite proxy, leave this empty or use /api
VITE_API_URL=/api

# For development against a different backend server, use:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4567/api
